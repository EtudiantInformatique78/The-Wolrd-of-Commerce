# The-World-of-Commerce
A software that model the world of commerce and the ecological impact. 


## How the idea came from

I love the book "The World of Commerce" from Andr√© Lefranc and Edward Sladen. It explains economy teached during the 1950s in France. As for me, I never learnt economy. In France, I studied science. In High School, I studied Biology, Geology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics. Then I studied Computer science at the "Paris Sud" University (nowadays, It's Paris-Saclay) and I continued to learn software engineering at Polytech School of Engineering. I think I have a scientific view of the world. I am atheist and ecologist. However, I never learnt economy. 

It's difficult to have economics point of view in a world dominated by rich people without knowing anything about economy. It's like feeling there is something wrong about the fact that modest people represent the vast majority of people in the world and that rich people are just riches and decide everything.

There is idea about what can be the world. However, because it's not necessarely possible to test every economical idea, I thing having a model based on hypothesis and real world is better. 

Of course, I am nobody. I don't claim I can create something new or necessarely relevant for real-world economy. However, I think it's might be fun to see how economy could be with some hypothesis. 

As a computer scientist, I want to develop a software that model the economy, including trade, transport, warehousing, insurance and banking. Moreover, I am a vegetarian ecologist and I want to use this software to include ecological concern in this modelisation.
